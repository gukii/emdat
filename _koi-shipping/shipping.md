### INTERNATIONAL KOI TRANSPORT

IKI has the expertise to ship Koi from Japan to Taiwan and from Taiwan to many cities in China via air transport (e.g. Shanghai, Guangdong). The parent Koi get tested and certified before being shipped.

Apart from providing parent Koi to our customers, IKI also offers its expertise and transport services to Koi businesses.

Our supply chains follow a legal, certified and professional model, bringing high-grade Koi to consumers along the supply chain.

### CHAIN OF CUSTODY

A chain of custody involves professional keeping and health checking of Koi at every stage within the supply chain.

Our activity in education, research and certification allows IKI to establish secure supply-chain channels for transporting and handling Koi. The transparent standards of service and quality, alongside the standards enforced for certification, position IKI to create this very valuable infrastructure.

Certified businesses become part of the “chain of custody”, where all supply chain members handling fish are clearly identified, tests are taken and controls are in place. The benefits of a chain of custody and certified businesses become amplified during periods of health concerns within the market.

### PARENT KOI HEALTH CHECKS

Health check involving blood tests and virology, ultra sound to determine the gender and state of eggs, use of X-ray to ensure Koi bones and bubble are without problem. The Koi get chipped and receive a IKI certificate in addition to the certificate of origin by the Koifarm (e.g. Sakai or Sing Chang).
